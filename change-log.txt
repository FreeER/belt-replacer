v0.0.1
    initial release
v0.0.2
    fixed bug with gui event being improperly triggered by other mod(s) :)
    made replacer slightly less likely to skip past belts (which should help it follow belts better, especially on turns)
    replacer will now return to belt chest and wait when out of belts
    fixed bug that replacing a belt with items on it would 'freeze' the items
    known issues:
        replacer gets easily confused by close belts
        replacer sometimes misses a turned belt, which can cause backup issues if items are currently on the belt...
        'done' replacers return to chest and then start wandering...
