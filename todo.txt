    [x] (partial) Track turns better (doing each belt in order instead of skipping around and then going back would probably help that, I think sorting the found belt table by distance from the replacer might work).
    [x] Changing the gui to a settings gui (instead of popping up on placement of each replacer), not sure how I want to implement that yet since you'd rarely change the settings I wouldn't want the button to be there all the time, but I also wouldn't want to require people to use the console to activate it...maybe hovering over a replacer would popup the gui? Would 'require' changing the setting from each replacer to a glob value (might want a checkbox to allow individual settings post release...just for those times when you want most of your base running fast to save resources but want/need one or two main lines as express
    [x] Adding a checkbox (defaults to checked) to the gui to allow replacing corners with a faster belt (probably will require a table of belts sorted by speed...unfortunately I don't know of a way to get those in the control.lua...game.entityprototypes won't give it, nor will the lua/entity as far as I know...maybe I can grab it via data.raw and create some 'fake' recipes with a name of speed-beltname and never unlock those.)
    [x] when done place them in the belt chest if it still exists
    [x] Better sprite(s)
